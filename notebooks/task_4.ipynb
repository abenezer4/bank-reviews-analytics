    "\n",
    "Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Bank of Abyssinia (BOA), and Dashen Bank rely on their mobile apps as core customer touchpoints. The goal of this investigation was to analyze their Google Play Store reviews to uncover:\n",
    "- Key satisfaction drivers\n",
    "- Pain points\n",
    "- Requested enhancements\n",
    "- Root causes behind negative feedback patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Using insights from NLP, sentiment analysis, and TF-IDF-based thematic grouping, we now convert the raw outputs into stakeholder-ready findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with the original challenge objectives:\n",
    "- Extract themes such as “login issues”, “performance”, “network”  \n",
    "- Report app weaknesses and competitive differentiators  \n",
